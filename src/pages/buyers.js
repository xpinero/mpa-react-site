	<p>Why choose me as your Buyer’s Agent?

	Are you looking to buy a house? Let me help you!
	
	Purchasing a new home is the biggest financial decision most families will ever make. There are many complicated decisions involved in choosing your new home. To protect your interests and assure that you make the best possible decision, you need to have a real estate professional who is on your side and is an expert in the local market.
	
	As your Buyer’s Agent, I will work to negotiate the best terms and price for you.  During the negotiation process, I will be representing you, not the seller.  Best of all, the buyer’s agent services are free to you!  The seller pays the commission whether or not a buyer uses an agent, so your best option is to use someone who will be your trusted advocate.
	
	My goal is to get you the best possible home at the best possible price!</p>
