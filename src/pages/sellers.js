	<p>Why choose me as your Listing Agent?

	Are you looking to sell your home?   Get top dollar for your  home with me!
	
	Selling a home in the Greater Chattanooga area can be both exciting and a little overwhelming. When you are preparing to sell your home, having the right real estate agent on your side will help make the process less of a hassle.  I will help you price your home correctly, organize the showing appointments, negotiate the best contract terms, and work as a trusted, experienced advocate if negotiations become difficult.
	
	One of the most common issues that cause frustration is when a real estate agent is hard to reach.   Time is of the essence in real estate.   If an agent does not return calls or reply promptly to emails or texts, then you are not being made a priority.
	
	I will make your home a priority!  Prospective buyers for your home will find me easy to reach and quick to respond to all messages left for me.    Whether itâ€™s a phone call, email or text, they will be able to get in touch with me.</p>
